		<p><center>To recent times, while traveling, I always used Couchsurfing website. It is a unique opportunity not only to save hundreds of bucks while living free, but also meet locals and try out their lifestyle! It's highly advisable to travel via Couchsurfing with friends just for the sake of safety. I was hosted with the help of Couchsurfing in 10 different countries and by any means each of the experiences was unique. Try it out and see if this is a good option for you!

To find cheap flight fares I use Ryanair and Wizzair websites. If you don't have any destination in mind, they offer the cheapest flights from the closes airport to you, so it's a good way to start traveling on budget. You can find fares as cheap as 10 EUR to get to Norway, everything depends on your searching skills and timing!

For getting around in Europe to close distances use FlixBus. The tickets start from around 1 EUR and you can travel even between countries. </center></p>
